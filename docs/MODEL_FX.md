# Adding 3D model effects (ModelFx)

ModelFx lets any class show a 3D model in the world for a while: a summoned weapon, ice on a frozen mob, a floating rune, a shield... The Hand of Order hammer, the freeze crystals and every Prince of Abolition ability are built with it.

Nothing needs registering. You make a model, drop two files into the right folders, describe the effect in code and play it.

This guide is about the models themselves. What to do *with* them (make one fly and hit things, count down, link damage, take over a mob...) is in [SPELL_KIT.md](SPELL_KIT.md).

---

## 1. Make the model in Blockbench

1. **File → New → Java Block/Item.**
2. Build it out of cubes and paint it.
3. Keep these rules in mind (Minecraft's limits for this model type):
   - Coordinates must stay between **-16 and 32 pixels** on every axis (3 blocks). Make big things small and enlarge them with `.scale(...)` in code.
   - A cube can only be rotated by **-45, -22.5, 0, 22.5 or 45 degrees**, on one axis.
   - The model's **front is North (-Z)**. When played, the front points the way you tell it to face (usually the player's yaw). Up is +Y.
4. Decide the **pivot**: the point the model turns and scales around and that sits exactly on the spawn position.
   - Default: bottom center `(8, 0, 8)`, which is right for things standing on the ground (crystals, pillars).
   - Weapons: put it at the grip (the hammer uses `(8, -10, 8)`).
   - Note it down; you'll give it to `.pivot(x, y, z)`.

## 2. Put the files in place

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Model (File → Export → Export Block/Item Model) | `src/main/resources/assets/forgerealmmod/models/model_fx/<name>.json` |
| Texture PNG | `src/main/resources/assets/forgerealmmod/textures/model_fx/<name>.png` |

Open the JSON and check the `textures` part points at the PNG like this:

```json
"textures": {
  "0": "forgerealmmod:model_fx/<name>",
  "particle": "forgerealmmod:model_fx/<name>"
}
```

Blockbench usually writes this for you if the PNG is saved in that folder. Subfolders work too (`model_fx/swords/blade.json` → `"forgerealmmod:model_fx/swords/blade"`).

A model can use several textures (`"1"`, `"2"`, `"3"`...), as the Hand of Order sword does; each one just needs its PNG in `textures/model_fx/`. Animated textures work like on blocks: stack the frames vertically in the PNG and put a `<name>.png.mcmeta` next to it, e.g. `{"animation":{"frametime":3}}`.

Every model in `models/model_fx/` is loaded automatically when the game starts.

**Quick check in game** (shows it at your feet for 5 seconds):

```
/particle forgerealmmod:model{model:"forgerealmmod:model_fx/<name>",glow:1b,lifetime:100} ~ ~ ~ 0 0 0 0 1
```

A purple and black cube means the model or texture path is wrong. The yes/no options from section 3 can be added the same way: `see_through:1b`, `unshaded:1b`.

You can try an animation the same way, without restarting the game. `keys` takes the same things as the code in section 4 (`from` + `tick` is a `.during`):

```
/particle forgerealmmod:model{model:"forgerealmmod:model_fx/<name>",glow:1b,lifetime:100,keys:[{tick:20,pitch:90f,ease:"in"},{tick:30,spin:90f},{tick:100,forward:12f},{from:30,tick:100,yaw:1440f}]} ~ ~2 ~ 0 0 0 0 1
```

## 3. Describe the effect in code

Make it a constant at the top of your class, like `ParticleFx` and `SlashFx`. Every method returns a new copy, so you can make variants freely.

```java
private static final ModelFx RUNE = ModelFx.of("rune")      // models/model_fx/rune.json
        .scale(1.5f)                  // 1 = Blockbench size (16 px = 1 block)
        .pivot(8, 8, 8)               // pixels, Blockbench coordinates
        .glow()                       // full bright, visible at night
        .aura(0xFF80C0FF, 0.1f, 3)    // glowing outline: ARGB color, thickness in blocks, softness
        .lifetime(60)                 // ticks (20 = 1 second)
        .fade(5, 10)                  // fade in 5 ticks, fade out the last 10
        .spin(6f);                    // turns around its own up axis the whole time, degrees per tick
```

### All options

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ModelFx.of("name")` | Model from `models/model_fx/name.json` |
| `.scale(s)` / `.scale(x, y, z)` | Size. Per-axis version for stretching (e.g. fit a mob's box) |
| `.pivot(x, y, z)` | Turn/scale point in Blockbench pixels (default `8, 0, 8`) |
| `.rotation(yaw, pitch, roll)` | Fixed starting orientation (added to what you pass when playing it) |
| `.color(argb)` | Tint and opacity. `0x80FFFFFF` = half see-through |
| `.glow()` | Full bright: not darkened by night or caves |
| `.unshaded()` | Every face equally bright, whichever way it points. For fire, light and energy (see below) |
| `.seeThrough()` | For textures with transparent pixels (ice, glass, energy). Drawn last so things inside stay visible |
| `.aura(argb, blocks, layers)` | Glow around it. Alpha of the color = strength. 1 layer = hard edge, 3-4 = soft |
| `.noAura()` | Remove the aura from a copy |
| `.lifetime(ticks)` | How long it stays |
| `.delay(ticks)` | Wait before appearing |
| `.fade(in, out)` | Fade in / fade out ticks |
| `.spin(degPerTick)` | Keeps turning around its own up axis the whole time |
| `.key(tick, pose)` / `.key(tick, pose, ease)` | Animation keyframe (see below) |
| `.during(from, to, pose)` / `.during(from, to, pose, ease)` | Extra animation that runs at the same time as the keyframes (see below) |
| `.noKeys()` | Remove all keyframes and `.during` animations |
| `.frames(n)` | The model is `n` models, `<name>_0` .. `<name>_(n-1)`, and changes shape (see "Models that change shape") |
| `.smooth()` | With `.frames(n)`: glide between the frames instead of jumping |
| `.mirrored()` | Flipped left-right, like in a mirror: a left hand out of a right hand |
| `.tag("name")` | A name for a model stuck to an entity, so it can be removed on its own (see section 5) |

### Solid things, or fire and light?

Minecraft shades every model: the top is brightest, the sides are darker (down to half) and the underside is darkest. That is what makes a hammer or an ice spike look solid, and `.glow()` does not turn it off.

On fire it looks wrong: a white-hot flame turns grey on two of its sides and changes brightness while it spins. So:

| The model is | Use |
|---|---|
| A solid thing: weapon, rock, ice | `.glow()` (and an `.aura(...)` if it should shine) |
| Fire, light, energy, magic circles | `.glow().unshaded().seeThrough()` |

Two things to know about `.aura(...)`:

- It lights up the **whole box** of every cube and ignores see-through pixels. On a flat plate or a flame texture you get a glowing rectangle. Leave the aura off those. If a model needs both (a rock with flames), split it into two models and play them together with the same keys, like `meteor` + `meteor_tail`.
- Every cube adds its own glow, so it piles up on models made of cubes inside cubes. A strong aura turns a dark layered model into one bright blob. Use a low alpha there (the entropy sphere uses `0x40......`).

Models built in layers (a core with see-through shells around it) need nothing special: the game sorts the faces by distance, so the order of the cubes in Blockbench does not matter. The inside only shows through pixels of the outer cubes that are see-through in the texture.

## 4. Animate it with keyframes

A keyframe says: **by this tick, these things have these values.** Ticks count from when the model appears.

```java
ModelFx sword = SWORD
        .key(20, ModelFx.pose().pitch(90), ModelFx.Ease.IN)     // ticks 0-20:  tips forward
        .key(30, ModelFx.pose().yaw(90))                        // ticks 20-30: turns right, STILL tipped forward
        .key(60, ModelFx.pose().forward(10), ModelFx.Ease.IN);  // ticks 30-60: flies forward, still tipped + turned
```

The rules:

- **A key only changes what it names.** `pose().yaw(90)` touches the yaw and nothing else, so the pitch from the key before stays. Keys "stick".
- **A key starts moving when the key before it is reached** (the first one starts at tick 0), and uses its own ease.
- **Everything starts at rest**: no offset, no rotation, scale 1, alpha 1. Use `.key(0, ...)` to start from something else, e.g. `.key(0, ModelFx.pose().scale(0.3f).alpha(0f))` to start small and invisible.
- After the last key it holds what it has.
- `ModelFx.rest()` is a pose that puts **everything** back to the start in one go: `.key(80, ModelFx.rest())`.

What a pose can change:

```java
ModelFx.pose()            // changes nothing until you name something
    .forward(2f)          // blocks in front (the way the effect faces, however the model is turned)
    .up(1f)               // blocks up
    .right(0.5f)          // blocks to the right
    .pitch(90)            // + tips the top forward (a downward swing)
    .yaw(45)              // + turns right, around the world's up
    .roll(30)             // + tips the top to the right
    .spin(360)            // + turns around its OWN up axis (up in Blockbench), however it is tilted
    .scale(0.5f)          // multiplies .scale(...)
    .alpha(0f)            // 0 = invisible
```

All rotations happen around the pivot. Go past 360 to keep turning: `yaw(720)` is two full turns.

**How rotations combine.** They are always applied in the same order, whatever order you write them in: `spin` first, then `roll`, then `pitch`, then `yaw`. For a sword modelled standing up:

- `pitch(90)` tips it over so the blade points forward. It is now lying on its **edge**.
- adding `spin(90)` gives it a quarter turn around its own length: it still points forward, and now lies **flat** against the ground.
- adding `yaw(90)` instead swings the forward-pointing blade round to the right. It ends up sideways-on and still on its edge.

### Making a model lie flat

For a thin model that stands upright in Blockbench (a sword, a card, a rune plate):

| You want | Use |
|---|---|
| Lying flat, top pointing forward | `pose().pitch(90).spin(90)` |
| Lying flat, top pointing right | `pose().roll(90)` |
| Lying on its edge, top pointing forward | `pose().pitch(90)` |
| Flat and spinning like a thrown disc | one of the flat ones, then animate `yaw` (it turns around the world's up, so it stays flat) |

Once `pitch` is 90, no amount of `yaw` or `roll` will lay it flat: `yaw` only turns it around the world's up, and `roll` happens before the pitch. `spin` is the one that turns it around its own length. If the flat side ends up facing the wrong way, use `-90`.

To have it flat from the first frame, with no rotating into place, put it in a tick-0 key: `.key(0, ModelFx.pose().pitch(90).spin(90))`.

### Several things at the same time

**Same timing:** put them in one key. They move together.

```java
.key(60, ModelFx.pose().forward(10).up(2).scale(2f))    // flies forward, rises and grows, all during the same ticks
```

**Their own timing:** `.during(fromTick, toTick, pose, ease)` runs next to the keyframes. Add as many as you want; they can overlap the keys and each other.

```java
ModelFx sword = SWORD
        .key(20, ModelFx.pose().pitch(90), ModelFx.Ease.IN)
        .key(30, ModelFx.pose().yaw(90))
        .key(100, ModelFx.pose().forward(12), ModelFx.Ease.IN)      // flies forward during ticks 30-100...
        .during(30, 100, ModelFx.pose().spin(1440))                 // ...and spins 4 full turns on the way
        .during(0, 10, ModelFx.pose().scale(1.5f), ModelFx.Ease.OUT_BACK);  // ...and pops bigger in the first 10 ticks
```

Which spin to animate:

| You want | Animate |
|---|---|
| Turn around its own length/up axis (a drill, a spinning top), whatever way it's tilted | `spin` |
| Flat spin around the world's up (a thrown blade, a rotor) | `yaw` |
| Tumble end over end | `pitch` |

If a `.during` and a key change the *same* thing during the same ticks, the one that started later takes over.

Example: the Hand of Order sword (ability 3). It tips forward, turns flat, then flies forward while it spins flat like a thrown disc.

```java
ModelFx sword = HAND_OF_ORDER_SWORD
        .key(20, ModelFx.pose().pitch(90), ModelFx.Ease.IN)       // ticks 0-20: tips forward (on its edge)
        .key(30, ModelFx.pose().spin(90), ModelFx.Ease.IN)        // 20-30: quarter turn around its own length -> flat
        .key(40, ModelFx.pose().forward(5), ModelFx.Ease.IN)      // 30-40: lunges forward (still flat)
        .key(100, ModelFx.pose().forward(12), ModelFx.Ease.IN)    // 40-100: flies on
        .during(30, 100, ModelFx.pose().yaw(1440));               // ticks 30-100: 4 full turns, staying flat

ParticleShapes.model(sl, sword, player.position().add(0, 3, 0), player.getYRot(), 0f, 0f);
```

| Tick | pitch | spin | yaw | forward |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 20 | 90 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 30 | 90 | 90 | 0 | 0 |
| 40 | 90 | 90 | about 206 (spinning) | 5 |
| 100 | 90 | 90 | 1440 | 12 |

A `.during` carries on from wherever that value already is. If an earlier key had left the yaw at 90, four more turns would be `yaw(90 + 1440)`.

**Easing** (how it gets to a keyframe from the previous one):

| Ease | Feels like |
|---|---|
| `LINEAR` | constant speed |
| `IN` | slow then fast: falling, slamming |
| `OUT` | fast then slow: landing softly |
| `IN_OUT` | slow, fast, slow: winding up |
| `OUT_BACK` | overshoots then settles: popping into existence |
| `OUT_BOUNCE` | bounces at the end |

> **Effects written before keys stuck:** a key used to be a complete pose, so anything it didn't name snapped back to rest. If an old effect now stays small, invisible or rotated, add the value it should return to in the next key.

Example: the Hand of Order hammer swing. It starts small and invisible, so the next key says what size and alpha to go to.

```java
ORDER_HAMMER
    .key(0,  ModelFx.pose().pitch(-20).scale(0.3f).alpha(0f))
    .key(6,  ModelFx.pose().pitch(-35).scale(1f).alpha(1f), ModelFx.Ease.OUT_BACK)   // appears behind you
    .key(13, ModelFx.pose().pitch(-55), ModelFx.Ease.IN_OUT)     // winds up
    .key(18, ModelFx.pose().pitch(90),  ModelFx.Ease.IN)         // slams down
    .key(20, ModelFx.pose().pitch(85),  ModelFx.Ease.OUT)        // small bounce
    .key(23, ModelFx.pose().pitch(90),  ModelFx.Ease.IN);
```

### Models that change shape

A keyframe moves, turns and scales the whole model. For something that changes its *shape* (a hand closing, jaws snapping, wings beating), make one model per stage and let the effect step through them:

1. Build the first stage and export it as `<name>_0.json`.
2. Copy it, move or turn the cubes for the next stage, and export that as `<name>_1.json`, and so on. Don't add or delete cubes in between and don't repaint them, only move and turn them. All stages can share one texture.
3. Describe it with `.frames(count)` and animate `frame` in the keys, like any other value:

```java
private static final ModelFx HAND = ModelFx.of("pale_emperor/skeletal_hand_grasp")
        .frames(5).smooth()                 // skeletal_hand_grasp_0 .. _4, gliding from one to the next
        .scale(1.5f).pivot(8, -16, 8).lifetime(60).fade(3, 8)
        .key(0,  ModelFx.pose().frame(3).up(-4.5f))                     // starts half closed, under the ground
        .key(10, ModelFx.pose().up(0), ModelFx.Ease.OUT)                // rises out of it
        .during(4, 14,  ModelFx.pose().frame(0), ModelFx.Ease.OUT)      // while rising, opens wide
        .during(26, 32, ModelFx.pose().frame(4), ModelFx.Ease.IN);      // snaps shut
```

- `frame(n)` is which stage shows. It is animated like everything else: it eases, it can hold, it can run backwards (`frame(4)` then `frame(0)` closes and reopens).
- Without `.smooth()` the model jumps from stage to stage, like a flip book. With it the cubes travel from where they are in one stage to where they are in the next, so 5 stages are enough for a fluid movement.
- `.smooth()` needs stages made of the same cubes in the same order (step 2). Stages that don't match just jump. Keep each cube's turn between two stages at 45 degrees or less, or it looks squashed half way.
- Test it: `/particle forgerealmmod:model{model:"forgerealmmod:model_fx/pale_emperor/skeletal_hand_grasp",frames:5,smooth:1b,glow:1b,lifetime:100,pivot:[8.0,-16.0,8.0],keys:[{tick:20,frame:4f},{tick:60,frame:4f},{tick:80,frame:0f}]} ~ ~1 ~ 0 0 0 0 1`

## 5. Play it

Works from server code (everyone nearby sees it). Call it inside your ability method:

```java
// at a spot, facing the player's direction
ParticleShapes.model(sl, RUNE, position, player.getYRot(), 0f, 0f);

// facing the way an entity faces
ParticleShapes.model(sl, RUNE, position, player);

// stuck to an entity: moves with it, disappears when it dies or unloads
// offset is from its feet, in world directions
ParticleShapes.modelOn(sl, RUNE, mob, new Vec3(0, mob.getBbHeight(), 0), 0f, 0f, 0f);

// worn by an entity: stuck to it AND turning when it turns its body (wings, a crown)
// yaw 0 = the model's front looks the way the entity does
ParticleShapes.modelOnTurning(sl, WING, player, new Vec3(0, player.getBbHeight() * 0.75, 0), 0f, 0f, 0f);

// with its top (up in Blockbench) pointing along a direction: spears, arrows, meteors
ParticleShapes.modelAlong(sl, SPEAR, from, player.getLookAngle());

// remove everything stuck to an entity
ParticleShapes.clearModels(sl, mob);

// remove only the models with a certain tag
ParticleShapes.clearModels(sl, mob, "my_mark");
```

**Tags.** One mob can carry several effects at once: ice, a mark from your class, a marionette's strings. `clearModels(sl, mob)` wipes all of them. So give your model a tag when you make it, and clear by that tag:

```java
private static final ModelFx MARK = ModelFx.of("rune").tag("my_mark");

ParticleShapes.clearModels(sl, mob, "my_mark");        // cast again: one mark, not two
ParticleShapes.modelOn(sl, MARK, mob, new Vec3(0, mob.getBbHeight() + 0.4, 0), 0f, 0f, 0f);
```

`Freeze` does this (its ice is tagged `freeze`), so thawing a mob no longer removes other effects from it.

**Stuck or worn?** `modelOn` keeps the direction you gave it: a mark over a head, ice round a body, strings going up. `modelOnTurning` turns with the entity's body, in the air and while flying too: wings on a back, a crown, something held. Its offset does not turn, so use the offset for the height only and put anything sideways into the model's keys (`pose().right(...)`, `pose().forward(...)`), which do turn. It follows the body, not the head: wings stay on the back while the player looks around.

Models are sent to every player within 512 blocks, so a big one (a meteor, a falling blade) is seen from far away. The small 2D particles and slash trails are still only sent within 32 blocks.

> **Watch out:** methods never change the effect you call them on, they return a new one.
> `RUNE.key(...)` on its own line does nothing; keep the result:
> `ModelFx moving = RUNE.key(...).key(...);` and play `moving`.

Changing something per cast is just another copy:

```java
ParticleShapes.model(sl, RUNE.scale(3f).lifetime(100), position, yaw, 0f, 0f);
```

### Doing something when the animation reaches a point

The animation runs on the players' screens, so damage and sounds go on the server with `Later.run`, using the same tick as the keyframe:

```java
ParticleShapes.model(sl, hammer, grip, yaw, 0f, 0f);
Later.run(sl, 18, () -> hammerImpact(player, sl, impact));   // 18 = the slam keyframe
```

| `pale_emperor/skeletal_hand_grasp` | The same hand closing, in 5 stages: 0 = wide open (the same as `skeletal_hand_spread`), 4 = clenched | `(8, -16, 8)` | `.frames(5).smooth()`, then animate `frame` (see "Models that change shape") |
| `pale_emperor/emperor_hand` | The hand of the Pale Emperor, closing in 5 stages: bleached bone, gold talons and rings, a sigil in the palm, a feathered serpent coiled round the wrist with its head on the back of the hand | the cut end of the forearm `(8, -16, 8)` | `.frames(5).smooth()`. Without keys it shows stage 0, the open hand. `.glow()` suits the gold |
| `pale_emperor/underworld_arm` | An arm from behind the Door to the Underworld, closing in 5 stages: pale dead flesh torn to the bone, burial wrappings, black nails, a coin in the palm | `(8, -16, 8)` | `.frames(5).smooth()`. Play several from the gate with different yaw, roll and timing; `.mirrored()` for left arms |
| `pale_emperor/feathered_serpent` | The Feathered Serpent rearing out of the ground, 3 blocks tall, in 3 stages: 0 = mouth shut, its collar of feathers laid back; 2 = jaws wide, collar flared. Gold mask, pale-green eyes, fangs, forked tongue | where the neck leaves the ground `(8, -16, 12)` | `.frames(3).smooth()` |
| `pale_emperor/feathered_serpent_coil` | Its body, coiled in three rings on the ground, 2.5 blocks across | the middle of the coils `(8, -16, 8)` | Play it at the same spot as the head, each with its own pivot: the neck rises from the middle |
| `pale_emperor/pale_wing` | A wing of bleached bone and pale feathers stained yellow-green, in 5 stages: 0 = folded, 4 = spread, 2.5 blocks from shoulder to tip | the shoulder `(-10, 11.5, 8)` | `.frames(5).smooth()`. It grows toward the model's +X (the player's right); `.mirrored()` gives the other wing |
| `pale_emperor/death_skull` | A giant skull, 1.4 blocks wide and 2 tall: a band of pale-green mosaic edged in gold, a light in each eye. 3 stages: 0 = teeth clenched, 2 = jaw dropped wide | its middle `(8, 8, 8)` | `.frames(3).smooth()` |
| `pale_emperor/rib_cage` | Six pairs of ribs on a spine that lies along the ground, in 5 stages: 0 = spread open, 4 = closed into a cage. Inside it is 1.3 blocks wide and 1.7 tall, 2.9 long | the middle of the spine `(8, -16, 8)` | `.frames(5).smooth()`. The spine runs front to back. `.scale(2f)` closes round a player |
| `pale_emperor/bone_spikes` | A cluster of bone spikes breaking out of the ground, 2.75 blocks tall | the base of the tallest `(8, -16, 8)` | Start it under the ground with `pose().up(...)` and bring it up fast |
| `pale_emperor/bone_spear` | A spear of bone, 3 blocks long, tip up: a notched blade with barbs, a gold socket, two feathers | middle of the shaft `(8, 8, 8)`, tip `(8, 32, 8)` | For `modelAlong` |
| `pale_emperor/coffin` | A black coffin standing upright, 2.75 blocks tall, gold pictures on its lid. 4 stages: 0 = shut, 3 = the lid swung wide open on its left edge. A skeleton lies inside, a coin on each eye | the middle of its foot `(8, -16, 8)` | `.frames(4).smooth()`. Lid = front |
| `pale_emperor/tombstone` | A weathered headstone, 1.75 blocks tall, with a glowing hourglass mark and a candle; a grave mound in front of it with three bone fingers coming out | under the stone `(8, -16, 8)` | The grave reaches 1.2 blocks toward the front: a good place to play a `skeletal_hand` |
| `pale_emperor/underworld_chain` | A chain of dark iron, 2.9 blocks long, a four-clawed grab at its upper end | the far end `(8, -14, 8)`, or the tips of the claws `(8, 32, 8)` | For `modelAlong`. `.scale(1, length, 1)` stretches it |
| `pale_emperor/pale_crown` | The crown of the Pale Emperor: a gold band with pale-green stones, a serpent rearing at its front, a fan of pale feathers behind | default `(8, 0, 8)` = the middle of the band, at its lower edge | The band is 10 px wide: at `.scale(1)` it fits a player's head |
| `pale_emperor/pale_feather` | One pale feather, 1.5 blocks long, tip up | its middle `(8, 8, 8)` | `.scale(0.4f)` for a feather that drifts down; full size and `modelAlong` for one that is thrown |
| `pale_emperor/wraith` | A hooded spirit of the dead, 2.7 blocks tall: a skull deep in the hood with lights for eyes, a robe worn to rags, clawed arms of bare bone. 3 stages: 0 = arms hanging, 2 = reaching out | under it `(8, -16, 8)` | `.frames(3).smooth()`. Face = front |
| `pale_emperor/death_sigil` | A flat seal for the ground, 3 blocks wide: a ring of runes, a feathered serpent biting its tail, eight feathers and an hourglass | default (its middle) | `.glow().unshaded().seeThrough()` |
| `pale_emperor/death_sigil_ring`, `death_sigil_core` | The outer and the inner half of that seal | default | Play both and give them opposite `.spin(...)` |

The fire and light ones (`orb`, `thread` and `projection` too) want `.glow().unshaded().seeThrough()`; the solid ones `.glow()`.

Flat plates (`rune_circle`, `shock_ring`) lie on the ground as they are. Play them a little above it so they don't flicker inside the block: `ground.add(0, 0.05, 0)`.

### Pale Emperor: ready-made displays

`PaleEmperorFx` (next to `PaleEmperor`) shows every Death-pathway model the way it looks best: size, pivot, timing and animation are already chosen. Each display is one call.

**See them in game** (needs cheats, like `/soul`). Stand on flat ground:

| Command | What you get |
|---|---|
| `/palefx all` | Every display at once in a ring 16 blocks around you, played three times. `/palefx all 5` plays them five times |
| `/palefx serpent` | Just that one, 7 blocks in front of you and turned toward you. Press TAB after `/palefx` for the names |

**Use them in an ability.** `ground` is a spot on the floor, `yaw` the way the front looks (`player.getYRot()` = away from the player):

```java
PaleEmperorFx.ribCage(sl, enemy.position(), player.getYRot());
Later.run(sl, PaleEmperorFx.RIB_CAGE_SHUT, () -> cageShut(player, sl, enemy));    // the tick the cage is shut
```

| Call | What happens | Ticks to hang damage on |
|---|---|---|
| `serpent(sl, ground, yaw)` | A seal opens, the coils rise, the Feathered Serpent rears up 6 blocks, roars, strikes once and sinks | `SERPENT_ROARS`, `SERPENT_BITES` (4 blocks in front of it) |
| `skull(sl, ground, yaw)` | A skull 4 blocks tall hangs in the air, throws its head back with its jaw wide, chatters its teeth and fades | `SKULL_SCREAMS` |
| `ribCage(sl, ground, yaw)` | Ribs break out of the ground, snap shut, hold, open and sink | `RIB_CAGE_SHUT`, `RIB_CAGE_OPENS` |
| `boneSpikes(sl, ground, yaw)` | Spikes burst out, stand and sink back | `SPIKES_OUT` |
| `boneSpear(sl, ground, yaw)` | A spear appears point up, turns once, tips forward and flies 26 blocks | `SPEAR_FLIES` |
| `boneSpearThrow(sl, from, direction)` | A spear thrown along a direction: 24 blocks in 16 ticks | |
| `coffin(sl, ground, yaw)` | A coffin rises, its lid swings open, a wraith comes out; the lid slams and it sinks | `COFFIN_OPEN` |
| `wraith(sl, ground, yaw)` | A wraith rises, drifts forward with its arms out and fades | `WRAITH_REACHES` |
| `tombstone(sl, ground, yaw)` | A headstone rises and a skeletal hand breaks out of its grave and grasps | `GRAVE_HAND_GRASPS` |
| `chain(sl, from, to)` | One chain shoots from a spot and its claws reach another; it is stretched to fit | `CHAIN_ARRIVES` |
| `chains(sl, ground, yaw)` | A seal opens and four chains shoot from its rim to its middle | `CHAIN_ARRIVES` |
| `seal(sl, ground, yaw, blocksWide, ticks)` | The seal, its two halves turning against each other | |
| `featherFall(sl, ground, radius, count)` | Feathers drift down onto a round patch, swaying and turning | |
| `emperorHand(sl, ground, yaw)` | The Emperor's hand rises 6 blocks, opens, closes and sinks | `EMPEROR_HAND_GRASPS` |
| `underworldArms(sl, ground, yaw, count)` | Arms of the dead rise in a ring, lean in and clutch at the middle | |
| `wings(sl, entity)` | Wings on its back: they unfold, beat four times and fold away | |
| `wings(sl, entity, ticks, tag)` | The same for as long as you want (a flight, a transformation): they keep beating and fold in the last second. Calling it again with the same tag replaces them | `WINGS_SHORTEST` (fewer ticks than this shows none) |
| `foldWings(sl, entity, tag)` | Folds away, now, the wings that were put on with that tag | |
| `crown(sl, entity)` | The crown comes down turning and settles on its head | |

Each display also has a `..._TICKS` number: how long it lasts.

The effects themselves are public constants (`PaleEmperorFx.SKULL`, `RIB_CAGE`, `COFFIN`, `WING_RIGHT` ...). To change one, copy it into your class and edit it, or adjust a copy on the spot: `PaleEmperorFx.SKULL.scale(4f)`.

The wings and the crown are worn: they move with the entity they are on and turn when it turns (`modelOnTurning`).

## Tricks worth copying

All of these are in `PrinceOfAbolition.java`, with the helper named in brackets.

The helpers mentioned below no longer need copying: `warningCircle`, `shockRing` and `fireBurst` are in `combat/SpellFx`, and `clearStart`, `groundAt` and `aimGround` are in `combat/Spells`, ready to call from any class. A model that flies and hits things is one line with `combat/Shot`. See [SPELL_KIT.md](SPELL_KIT.md).

**Flying along a direction** (`spearThrow`, `launchFireball`). `modelAlong` turns the model so its up points the way you give it. From then on `up(...)` in the keys moves it along that line:

```java
ModelFx spear = SPEAR.lifetime(12)
        .key(4, ModelFx.pose().up(-1f), ModelFx.Ease.OUT_BACK)     // drawn back a block
        .key(12, ModelFx.pose().up(20f));                          // flies 20 blocks
ParticleShapes.modelAlong(sl, spear, from, player.getLookAngle());
```

**Dropping out of the sky, head first** (`hammerFall`, `spearFromSky`). Play the model upside down (pitch 180) with the pivot on the part that should land. Its up now points down, so `up(-22)` is 22 blocks above the spot and `up(0)` is the landing:

```java
ModelFx hammer = HAMMER.pivot(8, 30, 8)                            // the flat top of the head
        .key(0, ModelFx.pose().up(-22f))
        .key(7, ModelFx.pose().up(0f), ModelFx.Ease.IN);
ParticleShapes.model(sl, hammer, ground, yaw, 180f, 0f);           // pitch 180 = upside down
Later.run(sl, 7, () -> hammerImpact(player, sl, ground));          // your own method: damage, sounds, particles
```

**A circle that warns where it will land** (`warningCircle`), **a ring racing outward** (`shockRing`), **an explosion** (`fireBurst`) and **something heavy hitting the ground** (`groundSlam`) are small helpers in that file, under "Looks shared by the abilities". Copy them into your class or call the same models.

**One hit per enemy from many models** (`iceSpikes`). Ten spikes in a row would hurt a mob three times. They share one `Set<LivingEntity>` and skip whoever is already in it.

**Starting beside the player** (`clearStart`). A model that appears next to you (a spear at your shoulder) starts inside the wall when you stand against one, and a ray that starts inside a block stops at once. `clearStart` moves the start back to just in front of the wall.

**Finding the ground under a spot** (`groundAt`, `aimGround`). They also work when the player aims at a ceiling or at the side of a hill.

## Recipe: a new effect from start to finish

Say you want a spear that falls from the sky onto a target.

1. Blockbench: model a spear standing upright, tip at the bottom. Pivot at the tip, e.g. `(8, 0, 8)`.
2. Save `models/model_fx/sky_spear.json` and `textures/model_fx/sky_spear.png`.
3. Test with `/particle forgerealmmod:model{model:"forgerealmmod:model_fx/sky_spear",lifetime:100} ~ ~ ~ 0 0 0 0 1`.
4. In your class:

```java
private static final ModelFx SKY_SPEAR = ModelFx.of("sky_spear")
        .scale(2f).glow().aura(0xFFFF4040, 0.1f, 3)
        .lifetime(40).fade(0, 10)
        .key(0,  ModelFx.pose().up(12f).alpha(0f))             // starts 12 blocks up, invisible
        .key(4,  ModelFx.pose().alpha(1f))                     // fades in (still 12 up)
        .key(12, ModelFx.pose().up(0f), ModelFx.Ease.IN);      // hits the ground at tick 12

// in the ability:
ParticleShapes.model(sl, SKY_SPEAR, target.position(), player.getYRot(), 0f, 0f);
Later.run(sl, 12, () -> target.hurt(player.damageSources().playerAttack(player), 20f));
```

---

## Freezing (bonus)

The ice look from Hand of Order is its own reusable status:

```java
Freeze.apply(target, 80);     // frozen 4 seconds: no AI for mobs, rooted for players
Freeze.isFrozen(target);
Freeze.ticksLeft(target);
Freeze.thaw(target);          // break the ice early (with the shatter effect)
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Purple/black cube | Model file name or its `textures` path is wrong, or the PNG isn't in `textures/model_fx/` |
| Model doesn't load at all | A cube is outside -16..32 px, or a rotation isn't -45/-22.5/0/22.5/45. Check the game log |
| Keyframes do nothing / it doesn't move | You called `.key(...)` but played the original. Save the result in a variable and play that |
| It never comes back from a key (stays small / invisible / rotated) | Keys stick. Name the value to return to in a later key (`.scale(1f).alpha(1f)`), or use `ModelFx.rest()` |
| Can't get it to lie flat | After `pitch(90)` use `spin(90)`, not `yaw` or `roll`. See "Making a model lie flat" in section 4 |
| Spin goes around the wrong axis | `spin` = its own up axis, `yaw` = the world's up, `pitch` = end over end. See the table in section 4 |
| Aura invisible | The color needs an alpha: `0xFFFF0000`, not `0xFF0000` |
| Points the wrong way | The front must be North (-Z) in Blockbench, or add `.rotation(180, 0, 0)` |
| Swings around the wrong spot | Set `.pivot(...)` to the right pixel coordinates |
| Things inside it disappear | Add `.seeThrough()` |
| Aura too bright / dim | Lower / raise the alpha of the aura color (`0x80...` is half strength) |
| Fire or light looks dull, grey on some sides, or flickers while it spins | Add `.unshaded()` |
| A glowing square around a flat plate or a flame | That is the aura. Remove it (`.noAura()`) |
| A dark model with shells turns into one bright blob | The aura piles up on layered models. Lower its alpha a lot (`0x40...`) |
| Inner part of a layered model is hidden | The outer cubes' texture is too solid there. Make those pixels see-through in the PNG |
| Faint parts vanish before the rest when it fades | Normal: the game drops pixels below 10% opacity |
| Not visible from far away | Models are sent within 512 blocks, but 2D particles and trails only within 32 |
| Ending one effect removes another effect's model from the same mob | Give each its own `.tag(...)` and use `clearModels(sl, mob, "tag")` |

The code lives in `src/main/java/net/lukario/frogerealm/particles/fx/` (`ModelFx`, `ModelFxRenderer`, `ModelFxParticle`). You only need to touch `ModelFx` to add new options.
